# Assignment 3

For this assignment, I took assignment two's files and created my first repository on GitHub. Then, I created another branch and converted the regular CSS into Sass. I also updated the stylesheets to incorporate Sass variables.

## Comments/Feedback
- I really understood this assignment after going through the process a second time. I appreciated having the assignment sheet, the recorded lecture, and the recorded Sass video.
- The printed directions do not discuss how to create another branch; this seemed odd since everything else was in the directions, even if it had been gone over in a video.
